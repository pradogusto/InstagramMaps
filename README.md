# ADA_Project
## AbstractFor the ADA's project we were inspired by a project called "GoodCityLife" lead by Luca Maria Aiello, Daniele Quercia, two data scientists of Nokia Bell labs and Rossano Schifanella, an assistant professor in computer science at the University of Turin. The main goal of their project was the following:Built new maps of 2 cities (London and Boston) based on one human emotion: happiness. With these new maps, people are not only able to find the shortest path from A to B, but also to find a path that optimize happiness. For this purpose, they developed an algorithm that try to optimize both shortness and happiness.In this Project, our is to build a "Happy Swiss Map" inspired by GoodCityLife project. Thanks to our professor Michele Catasta, we will have access to a large dataset of Instagram informations. We will focus in this project on the text part of each instagram.## What kind of data do we have ?Our first work will be to study our instagram dataset. We have in hand a dataset of very noisy datas and we have to clean them. This is the text pre-processing part, which code can be find in directory text_preprocessing

## Machine learning pipeline

We follow a standard pipeline using Naive Bayes multiclassification method that trains on 20% of the dataset and predict the 80% others. More details on the pipeline and accuracy of the method in ML_part directory.## Geo-localizationAny localization information was given in our dataset, then we decided to find it by ourselves. The algorithm is based on the tag list of every instagram. To have a look at the alto, the code can be found in localization
## VisualizationOur final step is to create a cartography of Switzerland that we can visualize. You can see all the result in the file Presentation.ipynb, and for more details about how the visualization was done, all the necessary is in the visualization directory.

## Conclusion

Finally, to see all the pipeline in one script, in_one_script.ipynb resume the all reasoning, all the functions used in in_one_script.ipynb are concatenated in functions.py. Before all, this project's aim was to introduce myself to big data calculus and practicing Spark for parallelize algorithms. Even if the final results are not relevant, the only fact that all the steps above mentioned have been run on almost 10-millions instagrams is a success.

Thank you to the all teaching team, Michele Catasta and especially Tiziano Piccardi who was very talkative on slack !!
